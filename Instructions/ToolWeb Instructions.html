<B><P>Introduction</P><DIR>

</B><P>The ToolWeb&trade; is a browser based interface for accessing all information stored in the Tooling Database. The ToolWeb&trade; runs on a local web server hosted securely within Spirol’s infrastructure. From the ToolWeb&trade;, users have access to:</P></DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Comprehensive Tooling Spec Sheets for each item and/or product line available.</LI>
<LI>Complete Tool Drawing information, including full detail lists in both tabular and individual formats.</LI></UL>
</UL>
<DIR>

<P>Engineering creates, edits, and maintains Tools, Tool Details, and Spec Sheets. The ToolWeb&trade; is intended to replace the previous method of having to maintain up to date binders of Spec Sheets or to request emails from Engineering. The ToolWeb&trade; is always available and will always have the most up to date information available.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Note:&#9;The Tooling Database is neither an inventory control nor a procurement system for tools. It is not capable of being used for these purposes in its current state, and there are no plans to modify it to be used as such in the foreseeable future.</P>
</DIR>

</DIR>

<B><P>How to get to the ToolWeb&trade;</P><DIR>

</B><P>There are two ways to navigate to the ToolWeb&trade;. These connections will only work with browsers directly connected through the Spirol intranet.</P></DIR>

<OL>

<LI>Navigate to <A HREF="http://enwww/">http://enwww/</A>. This is the main page for the Engineering site. Select the &quot;Controlled Drawings&quot; link on the left. This opens the Controlled Drawing portion of the site. From here, there is a link titled &quot;ToolWeb&quot; on the left.</LI>
<LI>Navigate directly to <A HREF="http://toolweb/">http://toolweb/</A></LI></OL>


<B><P>How to use the ToolWeb&trade; Interface</P><DIR>

</B><P>The ToolWeb&trade; is intended to allow users who know what they are looking for to be able to quickly access it. If a user needs a Tool Spec Sheet or Tool Drawing information, they will need to know at least one of the following:</P></DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Product Item Number</LI>
<LI>Product Drawing</LI>
<LI>Product Description</LI>
<LI>Tool Drawing number</LI>
<LI>Tool Name</LI></UL>
</UL>
<DIR>

<P>There are four (4) main sections of the Main Page, listed below. Each section is intended to address the varying levels of information available to the end user and allow them to retrieve the Tooling Data they need.</P>
<U><EM><P>Select the appropriate Product Line and Equipment Type:</P><DIR>

</U><P>This section requires the least amount of specific information by the user and allows for general browsing. Here, the user may only know the Product Line or the Equipment Type used to produce a given product.</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Each drop down list will restrict the other so that only allowable combinations are permitted. Once a valid combination has been selected, click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button for that section. This will take you to a Product List showing all the products that meet this criteria. This Product List is capable of being sorted by clicking on the headings.</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>In the left column of this Product List there is a &quot;Select&quot; link. By clicking on this link, either the unique Tool Spec Sheet for that product is displayed, or if there are multiple Spec Sheets for that product, a selectable list of all available Spec Sheets is displayed.</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Clicking on the &quot;Reset&quot; button clears the Product Line and Equipment Type drop down lists so that a new search can be executed.</LI></UL>
</UL>
<DIR>

<U><P>Enter Query Text (Product Item Number, Product Drawing, or Description):</P><DIR>

</U><P>The text box in this section allows for either a full or partial query string to be entered and the resultant Product List or Spec Sheet List that meet the criteria. These lists are capable of being sorted and allow for selection of the desired entry to display the final Spec Sheet. Common wildcards such as * or ? and operators such as AND, OR, +, or - are not supported.</P></DIR>

</EM><I><U><STRONG><P>Enter Tool Drawing Number or select from List:</P><DIR>

</I></U><P>This drop down list shows all the Tool Drawings active in the Tooling Database in alpha numerical order.</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Selecting a drawing in the list and clicking on the &quot;Submit&quot; button will display all the data and detail information for the Tool.</LI>
<LI>Text can be entered in the &quot;Filter by:&quot; box and clicking the &quot;Apply&quot; button. This will limit the drop down list to entries that meet the &quot;Filter by:&quot; criteria. This can be drawing number prefixes such as &quot;A-48&quot; or drawing names such as &quot;perform&quot;. Partial or whole entries are acceptable, but wildcards as listed above are not supported.</LI></UL>
</UL>
<DIR>

</STRONG><U><EM><P>Enter Spec Sheet ID (if known):</P><DIR>

</U></EM><P>This option is for users who know the Unique global identifier of the Spec Sheet they desire. It can be entered here and the Spec Sheet will be directly displayed</P>
</DIR>

<B><P>ToolWeb&trade; Security and Confidentiality</P><DIR>

</B><P>Tool Information is a closely held asset by Spirol. One of Spirol’s greatest competitive advantages is our Tooling systems and the inherent standardization it supports. All information contained in the Tooling Database is considered to be Confidential and Proprietary to Spirol and must be handled as such. All tool suppliers must be made aware of our policies and treat the information provided to them appropriately. Customers and competitors are NEVER permitted access to tooling information without express written consent by senior corporate level management.</P></DIR>
